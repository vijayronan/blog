Nmap is an open-source network scanner. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.
## Features
* **Host discovery** – Identifying hosts on a network. For example, listing the hosts that respond to TCP and/or ICMP requests or have a particular port open.
* **Port scanning** – Enumerating the open ports on target hosts.
* **Version detection** – Interrogating network services on remote devices to determine application name and version number
* **OS detection** – Determining the operating system and hardware characteristics of network devices.
* **Scriptable interaction with the target** – using Nmap Scripting Engine(NSE) and Lua programming language.
