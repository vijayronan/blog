Nexpose components:

* **Security Console** - This is the component youâ€™ll use to create sites, run scans, generate reports, and much more. The Security Console is accessed via a web-based user interface through any of our supported browsers.
* **PostgreSQL database** - The embedded PostgreSQL databases stores all the asset scan data and is used for generating reports.
* **Local Scan Engine** - Scan Engines are responsible for performing scan jobs on your assets. Your installation includes a local Scan Engine that you can use for trial purposes like this one. Note that Scan Engines only store scan data temporarily before sending it back to the Security Console for integration and long-term storage.
